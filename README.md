# go-glue
<b>A lightweight Golang microservice framework for rapid prototyping.</b>

Made to easily "glue" microservices together through simple application discovery and functional interfaces.  Supports multiple communications protocols (primarily through AMQP, but also through REST) and multiple Value Object serialized states (Protocol Buffers, XML, and JSON).

<i>Currently under initial development.</i>
